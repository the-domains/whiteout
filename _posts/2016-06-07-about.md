# ABOUT

## A TALENT AND CAREER ADVANCEMENT SERVICE

At WHITEOUT MANAGEMENT, our goal is to help catapult artists into being the best and most well-rounded in their fields using a diverse involvement of platforms and community service. 

Here at WHITEOUT MANAGEMENT, we place a large emphasis on community service. Our artist give back through our sister company, [LOUD KINGDOM][0] while still representing WHITEOUT MANAGEMENT. 

As a WHITEOUT artist, you will be expected to develop your craft, not just with management help, but on your own as well. 

## RECRUITMENT 

We aim to have a diverse roster of artists. We may not be able to manage 3 battle rappers at one time, or five dancers at one time, etc. If you are rejected, it is not necessarily because we don't believe in you as an artist. We encourage everyone initially interested in WHITEOUT MANAGEMENT to go through CYBER BRAND GROUP (CBG), and enlist in our Digital Footprint and Social Media Management service at [KIWI ENTERPRISES. ][1]

We want people who dream big and really push to make those dreams a reality. If after 6 months there has been too little to no growth, WHITEOUT MANAGEMENT may deem it fit to drop an artist from the roster.
